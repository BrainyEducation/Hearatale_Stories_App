[1]If a little angel just your size flew down from heaven it might tell you that heaven is nice and wonderful except sometimes little angels want to be just a tiny bit mischievous, like real kids, but forget how. If a little angel asked your advice on how to be just a tiny bit naughty and mischievous—even if it wasn’t April Fool’s Day—what would you suggest and recommend?

Would you suggest, maybe, putting a little bit of tape over the pointy end of the TV remote control so it won’t work and then ask somebody if they broke it—
[2]Or suggest getting a raisin to squish and stick on the back of your hand, and then in front of somebody quick-slap the squished raisin and say, “I just hate flies!” and then lick it up and eat it and smile sweetly—
[3]Or suggest squishing the raisin on the end of your finger and then pretend to dig it out of your nose and act like you’re going to wipe it on somebody’s bare arm or hand and say, “I hate boogers!”
Or suggest getting a piece of stem from a tomato or some other plant with parts like little legs, and hold it in the palm of your hand and say, “It’s not a dead spider, is it!” —and pretend to put it on somebody—
[4]Or suggest looking at somebody’s bare feet and asking, “Are your feet getting too big!”—and then at night put some toilet paper inside at the toe end to make their shoes seem too small—

Or suggest getting some thin gray cardboard to wet and squish and mix with dirt and mud till it looked like cat poop or dog poop, and then put it on some toilet paper and hide it outside the door and ask somebody, “When did the neighbor cat learn to use toilet paper?”
[5]But maybe you shouldn’t. If a little angel asked your advice about mischief, maybe you should just shake your head and shrug your shoulders and pretend you’re just like the little angel and don’t know anything about being naughty.
