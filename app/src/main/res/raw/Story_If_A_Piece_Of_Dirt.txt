[1]If piece of dirt felt sad and alone and unhappy, and didn’t have another piece of dirt to play with, and got tired of being a piece of dirt and wanted to be something new—it might wish it could have a friend who is a nice child like you.  It might think:
[2]I wish a nice little child friend would pour some water on me.  Then—Wow!—I wouldn’t be dirt—I’d turn into real MUD!
    And an especially nice child friend could pick me up and squeeze me and squeeze me, and then roll me around and around, and then—Wowie-Wow!—I could be ... a real MUD-BALL!
[3]And a wonderfully, especially nice child friend could pat me—flatter and flatter and flatter—and then, Wowee-Wowishous-Wow!—I could be...I know I could...a MUD-PIE!  A really, real mud-pie!
[4]Goodness-gracious!  And then a very, very most terrifically wonderfully especially nice child friend could find pretty pieces of rocks or leaves or pretty color paper or other pretty little things and decorate me!  And then let me dry, and keep me, and I could be the best, most delicious looking mud-pie anybody ever, ever did see!  Wowee-Wowishously-Wow-wow!
[5]And after a while, if I got tired of being a mud-pie, the most special child friend of all could crumble me up again, and I could be dirt again.  Yes, I could.
    And then my child friend could put water on me again and roll me back and forth and back and forth and roll me long and skinny like a snake!  And then could put the snake ends together and make me into a circle ring like a bracelet....and then squeeze me into a ball and pat me flat and scratch a Picture on me....or put me on the end of a stick like a pretend lollipop sucker, or....
[6]So, if a piece of dirt thought about a child friend like you it wouldn’t be sad any longer, but very, very happy thinking and imagining and pretending and wondering about what a very especially nice child friend could help it to be.
