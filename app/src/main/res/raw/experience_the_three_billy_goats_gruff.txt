Fold a piece of paper in half once, and then fold it in half again to mark four parts on the paper. In one part draw the smallest goat. In another part draw the middle size goat. In another part draw the biggest goat. In the last part draw the troll. Cut out the pictures of the goats and the troll so you can use the pictures to tell the story. For the grass hillsides you might use two pillows or two handkerchiefs or something else. For the bridge you might use a book or box or something else. Listen to the story being read again and use your pictures to show and tell the story. Show and tell the story to a friend or a grownup or at school.
Which character in the story is the meanest and cruelest, like a big bad bully? What does the troll want to do with the goats? Draw a different way the goats can get across the watery stream without using the bridge.
