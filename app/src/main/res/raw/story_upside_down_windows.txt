If you ever climb through a window check first to make sure the window’s not upside down, or you might crawl through into a strange different world where things are upside down and backwards.
    If you walked with your feet in the air and your head on the ground your hair would get awfully dirty awfully fast—but your shoes would last longer.
If you walked backwards would you only arrive where you left from and never get where you’re going?
    Would you have to take the grown-ups to school and scold them when they were naughty?
    Would you have to eat vegetables for dessert—but get to eat cake and cookies and ice cream and candy for breakfast and lunch and dinner?
Would you feel happy when you stubbed your toe or skinned your knee?
    Would you cry and feel sad when you got a birthday present or an extra holiday from school?
    Would a puppy pet your hair and make sure that you went potty outside and not on the rug?
    Would you go to the barber shop when your hair was too short and have the barber make your hair longer?
Would you stay up all night and only go to sleep during the daytime?
    Would you make your teachers do homework, and not let them talk without permission, and make them do time-out when they were naughty?
    If so, you’d better be careful and think twice before you ever climb through an upside down window.
