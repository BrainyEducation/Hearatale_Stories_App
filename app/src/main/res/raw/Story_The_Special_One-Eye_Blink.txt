If you could blink just one eye three times in a very special way, and then suddenly be just as tiny as your littlest fingernail is now, then you could hide from anyone.
    One drop of ice cream would be enough for breakfast and lunch and dinner, and a little piece of candy would seem bigger than a house.
    You could ride in your little toy car and race across the floor and bump into pillows and ride under the furniture.
One saucer of water would be like a swimming pool, and you could use a spoon as a diving board, and you could spread just a little bit of dish soap on the saucer’s edge and slip and slide all over the saucer, and you could float on the water on a bottle cap and use it as a boat.
You could tie a little thread round a butterfly’s neck to guide it, and ride that butterfly up, up in the air, higher than a tree.  And if the butterfly landed on a flower you could walk around inside, and all the flower petals would be like soft, beautiful, colored walls, and all you could smell would be the wonderful flower smell.
At night when the grown-ups were asleep you could climb up on their shoulder and whisper in their ear so quietly it would seem to them that your words were their very own thoughts, and you could make them dream about whatever you wanted—even about taking you to the zoo to see the giraffes and elephants and tigers and hippos and monkeys.
[5]But before the grownups woke up, you’d probably want to blink your other eye three times in a very special way, and then suddenly be just as big again as you were before you blinked your first eye.
