Do you think the first pig made a good choice when he decided to spend all his money on candy? Which pig made the best and smartest choice about saving and then spending his money? Do you think the three pigs were good brothers? Tell why you think that. What if the wolf had one or two brothers? If the wolf had brothers in the story, how do you think the wolf brothers might help each other?
Have you heard a different version of the story about the three pigs or seen a picture book version or watched a cartoon version of the story? If so, which version did you like best and why? Did a different version tell about the pig’s mother? Did the pigs have money in another version? Did the pigs buy candy in another version? Did the wolf say: “Little pig, little pig, let me come in.” Did the pig answer: “Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin.” Inthe other version, what happened to the wolf at the very end? Did he become the pigs’ dinner or did he run away?
