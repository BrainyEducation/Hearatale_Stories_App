[1]Tonight, at bedtime, you might think: What if I decide to be a kitten when I wake up?
    You might think: I could be an orange tiger-striped kitten, or black or brown or white, or all mixed up all together.
    You might think:  I’ll shrink my ears small and pointy and hairy all over so my cat ears can hear even the tiniest little scratch when a teeny little bird lands on the teeny tiniest little twig.
    In the dark night my bright kitty eyes can spy the littlest bittiest mouse muzzle-nose even in a shadow.
[2]When I jump far and leap high my twisty furry cat tail will bend and curl to keep my balance and I’ll never ever fall.
    My fingernails and toenails will grow sharp and tiny on my paw-fingers and paw-toes, and poke out to scratch threads from little kids’ stockings and sweaters, and scratch marks on naughty kids’ hands if they tease me.
    And sometimes I’ll tuck my claws back in and lick my paws wet to wipe all over my face to clean myself.  And sometimes I’ll use my tongue like a spoon to lick up milk or water or maybe even soft ice cream.
[3]My cat whiskers will tickle and twitch if things get too close to my face, so I can sneak and hide in tight places under a sofa or behind a cabinet or under a hat or  almost anywhere.
    When I purr my tummy will rumble, and when I get angry or scared I’ll hump my back up high and pretend to be bigger.
    Tonight, when you’re almost ready to doze off to sleep, you might think: What if I decide to be a kitten—or a puppy—or maybe a goldfish—or a squirrel—or maybe an eagle?
    You might—but I hope you’ll decide to be just you, yourself,  just exactly like you are right now, the most wonderfulest, most specialest, most lovalicious creature in the whole wide world.
