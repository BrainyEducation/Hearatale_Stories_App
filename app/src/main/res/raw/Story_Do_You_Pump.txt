[1]Do you ever pump your feet out front when you’re swinging forward and then back behind when you’re swinging backwards?  Do you pump to go higher and higher?  If you closed your eyes and pumped hard enough would you go so high that you could swing as high as the trees?  Or even higher than the trees?  Would you feel the wind blowing on you up there?
[2]Could you swing up as high as the birds and look them in the eye as they flew by?  What would they think?  Could you swing even higher than the birds, as high as the clouds?  Would it feel  kind of damp and wet to be up high in a foggy, misty cloud?
[3]Could you open your eyes and look down and see your teeny friends and your tiny family and your little bitty house?
[4]Could you swing as high as the moon?
[5]If you did, would the whole world we call the earth, the whole world we live on now, seem no bigger than a balloon?  If you could swing that high, would you close your eyes and swing and swing and swing back down and finally find yourself back in the very same place you started?
